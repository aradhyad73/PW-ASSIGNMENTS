    "Exceptions are runtime errors that can be handled and recovered from, while syntax errors are compile-time errors that prevent the program from running until the code is corrected. Handling exceptions is a crucial part of writing robust Python programs, as it allows you to gracefully respond to unexpected situations and prevent your program from crashing.\n",

    "#### Key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptions:\n",
    "Exceptions occur during runtime, i.e., while the program is running.\n",
    "They are caused by events or conditions that can happen during the execution of the program, such as division by zero, trying to access a non-existent file, or attempting to open a network connection that fails.\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully handle errors and continue the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors:\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the compilation phase before the program is executed.\n",
    "They are caused by mistakes in the program's code structure, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or invalid syntax elements.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. The code must be fixed before the program can be executed."

    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions that extend or subclass the built-in exception classes. They allow you to create your own exception types to represent specific error conditions or exceptional situations that are relevant to your application. Custom exceptions help in making your code more readable, maintainable, and can simplify error handling by providing more context about the nature of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Need custom exceptions :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Clarity: \n",
    "Custom exceptions make your code more semantically meaningful. When you raise or catch a custom exception, it clearly conveys the nature of the error or exceptional condition, making the code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separation of Concerns: \n",
    "Custom exceptions allow you to separate error-handling logic from the rest of your code. This separation can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Hierarchy:\n",
    "By creating a hierarchy of custom exceptions, you can group related exceptions under a common base class, making it easier to catch and handle specific types of errors while still providing a catch-all option."
