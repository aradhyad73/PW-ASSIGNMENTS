It provides methods to summarize and make inferences from data, helping in decision-making and understanding underlying patterns or trends.

    "### Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Definition: Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and organizing data. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. This includes calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation).\n",
    "Example: Suppose a teacher wants to summarize the test scores of a class. They might use descriptive statistics to calculate the average score (mean), the score that appears most frequently (mode), and the spread of scores (standard deviation).\n",
    "### 2. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Definition: Inferential statistics involve methods that allow us to make generalizations or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "Example: If a political analyst wants to predict the outcome of an election, they might conduct a poll (sample) and use inferential statistics to estimate the overall population's voting behavior, and test hypotheses about voter preferences."
